INTRODUCTION 

 

Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP) started as a project as part of the Simplifying the Business program. With the elimination of paper tickets, the boarding document does not carry a flight coupon anymore. This allows a more flexible format for the boarding pass. The passenger can now print a boarding pass at home, as the document can be printed on simple paper. Passengers can either go to the “bag drop” area or bypass the check-in desks and go directly to security.

PURPOSE 

 

The purpose of the project is to eliminate the need for magnetic stripe boarding passes by using IATA standard 2D barcode boarding passes which will cut costs and improve service at the same time. This will offer a paperless travel experience to passengers by removing airport check-in hassles and will save the industry over US $500 million per year. 

 

 

SCOPE 

 

Passengers can generate a Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP) from the comfort of their home. 

The boarding pass may now contain all the legs of the journey, instead of one document per leg, as was previously the case. 

A template containing fingerprint data could be stored on the boarding pass enabling a secure ID check at boarding.
